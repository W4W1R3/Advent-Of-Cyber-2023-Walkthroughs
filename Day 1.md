## Description

Enhancing Chatbot Security Through AI Assistance

    Safeguarding a chatbot from exploitation poses numerous challenges.
    Developers face the daunting task of anticipating and addressing a myriad of potential attacks. 
    Human limitations, however, make it impossible to cover every conceivable threat. 
    Enter another form of artificial intelligence - a solution to this conundrum.
    
The concept involves deploying a secondary AI, aptly named the "Interceptor," to intercept user messages and scrutinize them for any signs of malicious input before relaying them to the chatbot. 

    The Interceptor operates as a continuously learning system, regularly trained on a variety of malicious inputs. 
    With each use and attempted attack, it evolves, becoming more adept at identifying and thwarting malicious input.
    When coupled with a well-designed system prompt, this approach significantly fortifies the security of the chatbot. 
    Nevertheless, achieving absolute security remains elusive. 
    The Interceptor, while proficient, is not foolproof. 
    New, innovative attacks may emerge, challenging its capabilities and uncovering potential vulnerabilities.
    Persistent exploration of the system might unveil intricacies and loopholes susceptible to exploitation. 
    As with any security measure, vigilance and adaptability are crucial for staying one step ahead of evolving threats.
