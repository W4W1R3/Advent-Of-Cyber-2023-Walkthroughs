## Data Science in Cybersecurity

The integration of data science is rapidly gaining prominence in the field of Cybersecurity due to its capacity to provide valuable insights. The analysis of data, including log events, facilitates an intelligent comprehension of ongoing activities within an organization. An illustrative application of data science in Cybersecurity is anomaly detection. Other notable uses include:

    - **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** SIEM systems collect and correlate extensive data to offer a comprehensive understanding of the organization's landscape.
    
    - **Threat Trend Analysis:** Tracking and comprehending emerging threats become more effective.
    
    - **Predictive Analysis:** By scrutinizing historical events, it becomes possible to create a potential picture of the future threat landscape. This proactive approach aids in incident prevention.
